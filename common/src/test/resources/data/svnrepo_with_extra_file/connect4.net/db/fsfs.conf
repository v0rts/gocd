### This file controls the configuration of the FSFS filesystem.

[memcached-servers]
### These options name memcached servers used to cache internal FSFS
### data.  See http://www.danga.com/memcached/ for more information on
### memcached.  To use memcached with FSFS, run one or more memcached
### servers, and specify each of them as an option like so:
# first-server = 127.0.0.1:11211
# remote-memcached = mymemcached.corp.example.com:11212
### The option name is ignored; the value is of the form HOST:PORT.
### memcached servers can be shared between multiple repositories;
### however, if you do this, you *must* ensure that repositories have
### distinct UUIDs and paths, or else cached data from one repository
### might be used by another accidentally.  Note also that memcached has
### no authentication for reads or writes, so you must ensure that your
### memcached servers are only accessible by trusted users.

[caches]
### When a cache-related error occurs, normally Subversion ignores it
### and continues, logging an error if the server is appropriately
### configured (and ignoring it with file:// access).  To make
### Subversion never ignore cache errors, uncomment this line.
# fail-stop = true

[rep-sharing]
### To conserve space, the filesystem can optionally avoid storing
### duplicate representations.  This comes at a slight cost in performace,
### as maintaining a database of shared representations can increase
### commit times.  The space savings are dependent upon the size of the
### repository, the number of objects it contains and the amount of
### duplication between them, usually a function of the branching and
### merging process.
###
### The following parameter enables rep-sharing in the repository.  It can
### be switched on and off at will, but for best space-saving results
### should be enabled consistently over the life of the repository.
# enable-rep-sharing = false
