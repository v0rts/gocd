    Spring WebMVC 4.3.x does not appear to be affected by https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22060 based on review
    of the patches made to `LogFormatUtils` in the fixed 5.2.19.RELEASE version: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/compare/v5.2.18.RELEASE...v5.2.19.RELEASE
    This is because in Spring 4.3 all of these log statements are at TRACE level, which are very unlikely to be enabled
    for a GoCD instance in production, and not in the default configuration

    It is not believed that GoCD is directly vulnerable to the "SpringShell" attack since although we use WAR
    deployment, GoCD uses Jetty rather than Tomcat, and does not have the vulnerable classloader from Tomcat

    From review of https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2021-22112 and the code of GoCD, GoCD does not appear to be
    subject to this defect, since it does not alter the security context in the manner required to elevate privileges
    in a small portion of the application and potentially be subject to this defect.

    According to https://spring.io/security/cve-2023-20862 this affects 5.7 but not "earlier unsupported versions" so there is no

    From review of https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23463 GoCD is not subject to this XXE vulnerability, because

    H2 1.4.x which is a breaking change. See https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3195 and
